<h3>What Does This Tool Do?</h3>
<p>3DPredictor web tool can predict 3D genome contacts map for a chromosome region using information on CTCF binding and gene expression (RNA-Seq data).</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Files can be uploaded from local storage or external public resources, e.g. <a href="https://www.encodeproject.org/" target="_blank">ENCODE</a>, by FTP.
3DPredictor is definitely omnivorous thing, so it can be fed with gzipped and bzipped files too.</p>
<h4>CTCF Data</h4>
<p>Input data must be <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format12" target="_blank">narrowPeak</a> format.
No header, tab-separated table only is allowed.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="code code-wrap">
chr1	840081	840400	treat1_peak_1	69	.	4.89872	10.50944	6.91052	158
chr1	919419	919785	treat1_peak_2	87	.	5.85158	12.44148	8.70936	130
chr1	937220	937483	treat1_peak_3	66	.	4.87632	10.06728	6.61759	154
</pre>
<p>Columns significant for prediction are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>#1: Chromosome name</li>
<li>#2: Start position of peak</li>
<li>#3: End position of peak</li>
<li>#7: Fold-change</li>
</ul>
<h4>RNA-Seq Data</h4>
<p>RNA-Seq data is to contain fields <tt>gene_id</tt> and <tt>FPKM</tt>.
<tt>gene_id</tt> can be Ensemble ID or gene name.
This table must have header.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="code code-wrap">
gene_id	Gene Name	Reference	Strand	Start	End	Coverage	FPKM	TPM
ENSG00000185960.8	SHOX	chrX	+	624344	646823	0.000000	0.000000	0.000000
ENSG00000002834.13	SHOX	chrX	+	624344	659411	0.000000	0.000000	0.000000
</pre>
<aside>
<p><b>Note:</b> <tt>Gene name</tt> field in your RNA-seq file will be ignored.
If you would like to use gene name identifiers, place them into <tt>gene_id</tt> column.
ENSEMBL transcript quantifications are not allowed, gene quantifications only.</p>
</aside>
<h3>Genome</h3>
<p>Genome assembly should be relevant to your CTCF ChIP-seq data.
For RNA-seq data, genome version has no importance, because genomic coordinates are obtained from Ensembl for each gene/transcript.
3DPredictor does not use coordinates provided in the uploaded RNA-Seq data.</p>
<h3>Coordinates</h3>
<p>Chromosomal region for prediction must correspond to the format you can see on placeholder. 
Chromosome name is to start with <tt>chr</tt>, and commas are to be used as digit group separators.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote class="content-quote">chr12:1,000,000-1,200,000</blockquote>
<aside>
<p><b>Note:</b> Prediction is allowed at intervals 20kb to 10MB long, resolution 5kb.
Average processing speed is about 1MB per hour, so this may take long.
If you need prediction for interval longer than 10MB, please contact authors.</p>
</aside>
<h3>Model</h3>
<p>Trained models for human or mouse data at 5kb resolution are provided.
We strongly recommend to use model which was not trained on the chromosome of interest, to avoid overfitting.
E.g., if you need prediction for <tt>chr1</tt>, please use a model trained on even chromosomes.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>3DPredictor produces a gzipped HiC map with 3D-genome contacts.
Further it's sent to your e-mail with brief prediction report.
You can visualize this file using <a href="https://www.aidenlab.org/juicebox/" target="_blank">Juicebox</a>. 
If your job failed, please contact regnveig@yandex.ru.<p>

<p>Enjoy the prediction!
We hope it might be useful for your research ^_^</p>
